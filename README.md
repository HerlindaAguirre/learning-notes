# Learning Notes
## The Growth Mindset
The growth mindset is an attidue toward learning that allows you to grow in any new learning endevore. When learning something new its easy to become overwhelmed by new topics. With the growth mindset you learn to embrace new ideas and overcome obstacels with a more positive and persistant outlook. 
##### Compasion, Know-it-all, and Time 
1. It's important to be **compasionate** with one-self when starting something new. It's easy to fall into the fixed and  pessimistic mindset that eventually leads to self-sabotage.
2. You're **not** suppose to **know it all!** That is why you are here to learn after all.
3. Take a Break! It's important to understand that obstacles are part of the learning process. It's a good idea to step back and reevaluate all the steps you've taken to get to the point you are at. Do not be afraid to ask questions.
